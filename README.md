java cAnthropology 1: Introduction to Biological Anthropology Spring 2025This is a study guide organized by lecture covering topics from Lectures 1-12. In preparation for your midterm, you are responsible for understanding concepts at the level discussed in the textbook and lectures. The concepts listed here are not meant to cover all aspects of the course material but rather to help you focus on some specific questions. Similarly, the list of terms is not exhaustive and does not repeat the many terms defined already in your textbook. You are responsible for all material presented in lecture, section, and the lab notebook, even if it does not appear on this study guide. We look forward to seeing you at the review session and happy studying!
